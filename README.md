# Belly Button Diversity

## Overview 
### Purpose
The purpose of the Belly Button Diversity Module is to estabilish the ability to identify the top 10 bacterial species in each individual human's belly button microbiome. If the company, Improbable Beef, identifies a bacterial species as a candidate to manufacture the synthetic beef, then the selected subject will be able to identify whether that bacterial species is found in their navel. 

## Bar Chart -- Top 10 Bacterias found in belly buttons
We created this bar chart of the top 10 bacterias found in the navel in order to deremine what bacteria is the most common, and thus most useful for Improbable Beef.

## Bubble Chart
The bubble chart visualizes the different proportions of bacteria and how frequently they were found in each sample. The bubble chart provides a better visualization than the bar chart because we can see the difference in sizes based on count.

## Gauge Chart
The gauge chart is able to measure the weekly washing rate per subject and where they fall in comparison to the other subjects' weekly washing rates. The gauge chart visualizes how frequently subjects wash their belly buttons on a weekly basis.

## Application 
The final application is used for each subject to locate the their test specific number and then display the results that are related to their own belly button. Thus, volunteers in the study can understand the bacterial microbiome found in their navel, and how much of each bacteria is there. Finally, they can see where they fall on the spectrum of how frequently they should be washing their belly button.
